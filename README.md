# Basic AES Crypto challenge

This is a very basic crypto challenge I have setup for my fellow interns at SAP Labs. 
The basic idea is to find a secret message encrypted using AES-CTR. 
You may submit as many messages as you want to the server and it would gladly encrypt them for you. 
A handy tool has been set for you, so that should be a hint.

A detailed explanation is available. 


### How to run this on my own?

If you want to run this you will need to have a Node environment setup, or just run it on heroku.

You will need to set two config variables:
* SECRET_KEY: 128bit HEX string that will be used as your secret key.
* SECRET_MESSAGE: A plaintext string that will be the secret message.
